#### Description:

## Component enhancement with HOCs (higher-order components)

A higher-order component takes in a component as an argument and returns a supercharged component injected with additional data or functionality. The possibility of HOCs in React is due to React preference of composition over inheritance.

#### Benefits:

- offers a mechanism to increase or modify a component's functionality

- facilitating component reuse and code sharing.
