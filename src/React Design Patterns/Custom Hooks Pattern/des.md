### **4. Custom Hooks Pattern**

#### Description:

Encapsulates reusable logic in custom hooks, making it possible to share stateful logic across components without duplicating code.

#### Benefits:

- Makes stateful logic reusable and testable.
- Improves readability by reducing clutter in component files.
- Adheres to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

#### Example in Real Tools:

- **Apollo Client:** Custom hooks like `useQuery` and `useMutation` simplify data-fetching logic.
